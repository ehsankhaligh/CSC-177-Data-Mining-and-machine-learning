Data warehousing involves data preprocessing, data integration, and providing on-line analytical processing (OLAP) tools for the interactive analysis of multidimensional data, which facilitates effective data mining. Data mining is the automated extraction of hidden predictive information from databases. Data mining applies concepts and techniques from the fields of databases, machine learning, algorithms, information retrieval, and statistics. Topics include: data warehousing, association analysis, classification, clustering, numeric prediction, and selected advanced data mining topics.
